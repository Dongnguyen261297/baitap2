<hr />
<section>
  <p>
    Bitcoin (symbols: BTC, XBT, ) is a cryptocurrency , invented by an anonymous individual or organization using the name Satoshi Nakamoto as open source software [8] since 2009. [9] Bitcoin can be exchanged directly using an Internet-connected device without going through an intermediary financial institution . [ten]

    Bitcoin works differently than typical currencies: there is no central bank that regulates it, and the system is based on a peer-to-peer Internet protocol. [11] Bitcoin supply is automatic, limited, divided according to a predetermined schedule based on algorithms . Bitcoins are issued to Bitcoin "mining" computers as compensation for verifying Bitcoin transactions and recording them in a distributed ledger in a peer-to-peer network, via blockchain technology . This ledger uses Bitcoin as the unit of accounting. Each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis. [4]
